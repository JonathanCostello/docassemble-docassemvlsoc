  Hello! This is a tool to assist you with collecting all information you may require when renting a property. This tool will help automate the Statement of Condition form but simplifying the form into a Q&A.

  Next, the Q&A will progress through your potential rental. There are some general safety and information questions and room specific questions that will need to be answered.
